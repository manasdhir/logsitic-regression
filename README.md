In this notebook i have used pima indians dataset which contains information about the health statistics of women which can be used to determine if they have diabetes 
or not.I have used Logistic regression and naive bayes to perform this classification after preprocessing the data to replace null values with the serial mean, nearly same accuracy was obatained for both models.
Then I have also used decision trees to perform the same classification, in that notebook I have used IterativeImputer from fancyimpute to predict null values from other attributes using various regression models. Then I have identified the outliers first , all the values greater or less than 3 x (IQR)  are considered as outliers.Which are then replaced with the whisker values which is 25th percentile - (3 x (IQR)) for lower values and 75th percentile + (3 x (IQR)) for higher values.
Then i have trained two types of decision trees models one without regularization which overfits on training data and gives a very low testing accuracy and the other with max_depth as 4 which gives the highest testing accuracy for all the models used for this classification.
